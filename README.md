# Sudoku_Solver

I have used Python 3.8.5 and backtracking to make this Python Solver.

It just takes input from the user in the Sudoku_Input.txt file and gives the output in the Sudoku_Output.txt file which it will create at its first run.

There is a default sudoku board in the input file which looks something like:

7,8,0,4,0,0,1,2,0
6,0,0,0,7,5,0,0,9
0,0,0,6,0,1,0,7,8
0,0,7,0,4,0,2,6,0
0,0,1,0,5,0,9,3,0
9,0,4,0,6,0,0,0,5
0,7,0,3,0,0,0,1,2
1,2,0,0,0,7,4,0,0
0,4,9,2,0,6,0,0,7

The 0's here are for empty spaces and other numbers are just the values in their positions.

The user can also edit this file and add his/her own board.
